# Employee Management System

A modular Employee Management System containing backend microservices (Spring Boot) and a React frontend. This README is generated from the repository sources and reflects the actual code layout and endpoints observed in the project.

Repository layout (important paths)
- Employee Management/
  - Backend/
    - employee-service/employee-service (Spring Boot service exposing employee APIs)
    - attendance-service/attendance-service (Spring Boot service exposing attendance APIs)
    - leave-service/leave-service (Spring Boot service exposing leave APIs)
  - Frontend/
    - employee-portal (React application / Create React App)

Quick summary
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot) microservices
- Frontend: React (Create React App)
- Communication: Frontend uses axios to call backend services on localhost ports (see below)
- Build tools: Maven for Java services, npm/yarn for React app

Features (implemented or scaffolded in code)
- CRUD for employees (employee-service)
- Attendance management UI + API (attendance-service)
- Leave DTOs and a leave service skeleton (leave-service)
- React SPA with routes: /, /employees, /attendance, /leave, /payroll, /reviews, /projects

  - src/main/java/com/attendance_service/dto/EmployeeDTO.java
  - attendance-service controllers & service layers (expected)
- leave-service:
  - src/main/java/com/leave_service/dto/EmployeeDTO.java
  - src/test/java/.../LeaveServiceApplicationTests.java
- frontend:
  - employee-portal/src/App.js (routes & router)
  - employee-portal/src/components/Employee.js (uses axios -> http://localhost:8081/employees/get)
  - employee-portal/src/components/Attendance.js (uses axios -> http://localhost:8082/attendance/get)
  - employee-portal/public/index.html
  - employee-portal/README.md (CRA autogenerated)

Requirements
- Java 11+ (or the JDK version your project pom specifies)
- Maven 3.x
- Node.js 14+ and npm (or yarn) for the frontend
- A relational DB if you configure services to use Postgres/MySQL (services may also work with in-memory DBs if configured)

Running locally — backend services
Each backend service is a Spring Boot application. Typical commands (from repository root):

1. Build all backend modules (from project root)
```bash
# from repository root (adjust if your repo has a parent pom)
mvn -T 1C clean install
```

2. Run a single service
```bash
# employee-service
cd "Employee Management/Backend/employee-service/employee-service"
mvn spring-boot:run

# attendance-service
cd "../../attendance-service/attendance-service"
mvn spring-boot:run

# leave-service
cd "../../leave-service/leave-service"
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Notes:
- The EmployeeServiceApplication class is the entry point for the employee service.
- If a service's default port conflicts or is not configured, set server.port in application.properties or pass as an argument:
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--server.port=8081"
  ```
- Example application.properties (create or edit src/main/resources/application.properties in each service):
  ```
  # example for employee-service
  server.port=8081
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:employeedb
  spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
  spring.datasource.username=sa
  spring.datasource.password=
  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
  ```
  Replace datasource lines with Postgres/MySQL credentials if you want persistent storage.

Observed backend ports (from frontend code)
- employee-service: http://localhost:8081 (Employee.js calls /employees/get)
- attendance-service: http://localhost:8082 (Attendance.js calls /attendance/get)
Adjust these ports in each service configuration if you choose different ports.

Running locally — frontend (React)
1. Install dependencies and start dev server:
```bash
cd "Employee Management/Frontend/employee-portal"
npm install
npm start
# or
yarn install
yarn start
```

2. Default behavior:
- CRA dev server will open at http://localhost:3000
- The React components currently call the backend at the hardcoded URLs:
  - Employees: GET http://localhost:8081/employees/get
  - Attendance: GET http://localhost:8082/attendance/get
If you run the backend on different ports or behind a proxy, update the URLs in:
- employee-portal/src/components/Employee.js
- employee-portal/src/components/Attendance.js
(or centralize them in an env/config file)

APIs (observed/expected — update if different in controller code)
- Employee service
  - GET /employees/get — list employees (used by frontend)
  - POST /employees/add or /employees — create employee (common pattern)
  - PUT /employees/{id} — update employee
  - DELETE /employees/{id} — delete employee
- Attendance service
  - GET /attendance/get — list attendance records
  - POST /attendance/add — add attendance
  - PUT /attendance/{id} — update attendance
  - DELETE /attendance/{id} — delete attendance
- Leave service
  - DTOs exist for Employee; controllers likely expose leave endpoints such as /leave/*

Because controllers were not enumerated by the automated scan, check each service's src/main/java/*/controller folder to get exact routes.

Configuring environment (recommended)
- For React:
  - Create .env in employee-portal with values like:
    ```
    REACT_APP_EMPLOYEE_API=http://localhost:8081
    REACT_APP_ATTENDANCE_API=http://localhost:8082
    ```
  - Update components to use process.env.REACT_APP_EMPLOYEE_API etc.
- For Spring Boot:
  - Use application.properties or application.yml to set server.port and datasource.
  - Use environment variables or profile-specific files for different environments.

Testing
- Backend: run unit tests with Maven in each service:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
  Example test file found: leave-service/src/test/java/.../LeaveServiceApplicationTests.java
- Frontend: run CRA tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

Development notes & suggestions
- Centralize API base URLs in environment/config files to avoid editing components directly.
- Add Dockerfiles and docker-compose to run all services + DB + frontend together for easier local setup.
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger to each Spring Boot service for discoverable API docs.
- Add validation, error handling, and authentication (JWT/OAuth2) for production readiness.
- Add migration scripts (Flyway/Liquibase) if you use a persistent DB.

Contributing
- Fork -> branch -> PR
- Ensure tests pass and update README with any new commands or config changes

License
- Check repository LICENSE file. If none exists, add an appropriate license (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.).

Contact / Maintainer
- Maintainer: SaiSujith07
- Repo: https://github.com/SaiSujith07/Employee_Management_System

If you want, I can:
- generate example application.properties for each service with sensible defaults,
- add a docker-compose.yml that wires the frontend and services with an H2/Postgres DB,
- or update the frontend to read backend base URLs from environment variables and submit a patch.
